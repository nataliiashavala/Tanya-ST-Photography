The photos that I particularly like on any wedding day are those that capture those special, spontaneous moments. A tender glance shared by the couple, a mother’s smile, laughter between guests, a child’s curiosity… I won’t miss any details. It’s these moments that make your day as well as the more formal aspects such as the taking of your vows or the giving of the speeches."
